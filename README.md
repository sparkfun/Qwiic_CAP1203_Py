## Installation 

The first step to using this package is installing it on your system. The install method depends on the python platform. The following sections outline installation on Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

### Python 

The package is primarily installed using the `pip` command, downloading the package from the Python Index - "PyPi". Note - the below instructions outline installation an Linux-based (Raspberry Pi) system.

#### PyPi Installation

The SparkFun Qwiic CAP1203 Python package is part of the overall SparkFun Qwiic Python package which is hosted on PyPi. On systems that support PyPi installation via pip, this library is installed using the following commands

For all users (note: the user must have sudo privileges):
```sh
sudo pip install sparkfun-qwiic
```
For the current user:

```sh
pip install sparkfun-qwiic
```

#### Local Installation
To install, make sure the setuptools package is installed on the system.

Direct installation at the command line:
```sh
python setup.py install
```

To build a package for use with pip:
```sh
python setup.py sdist
 ```
A package file is built and placed in a subdirectory called dist. This package file can be installed using pip.
```sh
cd dist
pip install sparkfun_qwiic_cap1203-<version>.tar.gz
```

### MicroPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) to install mpremote on your computer.

Connect a device with MicroPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with mpremote mip.
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_cap1203_py
```

### CircuitPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/circup/en/latest/#installation) to install CircUp on your computer.

Ensure that you have the latest version of the SparkFun Qwiic CircuitPython bundle. 
```sh
circup bundle-add sparkfun/Qwiic_Py
```

Finally, connect a device with CircuitPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with circup.
```sh
circup install --py qwiic_cap1203
```

Example Use
 ---------------
Below is a quickstart program to print humidity, pressure, altitude, and temperature read from the CAP1203.

See the examples directory for more detailed use examples and [examples/README.md](https://github.com/sparkfun/qwiic_cap1203_py/blob/main/examples/README.md) for a summary of the available examples.

```python
import qwiic_cap1203
import sys

def runExample():
	print("\nQwiic CAP1203 Example 1 - Basic Readings\n")

	# Create instance of device
	myDevice = qwiic_cap1203.QwiicCAP1203()

	# Check if it's connected
	if myDevice.is_connected() == False:
		print("The device isn't connected to the system. Please check your connection", \
			file=sys.stderr)
		return

	# Initialize the device
	myDevice.begin()

	while True:
		if myDevice.is_left_touched():
			print("Left")
		if myDevice.is_middle_touched():
			print("Middle")
		if myDevice.is_right_touched():
			print("Right")

if __name__ == '__main__':
	try:
		runExample()
	except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit) as exErr:
		print("\nEnding Example")
		sys.exit(0)
```
